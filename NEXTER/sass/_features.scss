    // media-query-less responsiveness is achieved using the repeat() 
    // function and the auto-placement keywords.

    //auto-fill FILLS the row with as many columns as it can fit.
    // So it creates implicit columns whenever a new column can fit, because itâ€™s trying
    // to FILL the row with as many columns as it can.
    // The newly added columns can and may be empty, but they will still occupy a 
    //designated space in the row.

    //auto-fit FITS the CURRENTLY AVAILABLE columns into the space by 
    //expanding them so that they take up any available space. 
    //The browser does that after FILLING that extra space with extra columns
    // (as with auto-fill ) and then collapsing the empty ones.
